          I'm a recent graduate from Cornell University's College of Computing
          and Information Science with a keen interest in full-stack software
          engineering, machine learning, and generative AI (of course!). I've
          been working on a lot of independent projects recently, and I built
          this website to showcase some of my favorites.
          <b> Feel free to head over to the projects page, and try them out!</b>
