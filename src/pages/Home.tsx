          I'm a current Data Scientist and recent(ish) graduate of Cornell
          University's College of Computing and Information Science with a
          passion for data science, machine learning, generative AI (of
          course!). I've been working on a lot of independent projects recently,
          and I built this website to showcase some of my favorites.
